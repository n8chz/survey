<h1>Welcome to the AIS Ideology Sorter (AIS)</h1>
<p>This was originally called the "Agnostic Ideology Sorter."
This survey instrument is agnostic about how answers should be scored.
Instead, what is reported is how a given respondent's pattern of answers compares with those of other respondents.
The original name was abandoned in favor of "AIS Ideology Sorter" for a number of reasons.</p>
<ol><li>Inclusion of the word "agnostic" in the name may have created the impression that this was for use within the agnostic community.</li>
<li>"AIS Ideology Sorter" is a recursive algorithm, much as is "PHP Hypertext processor," in which AIS is written.</li></ol>
<p>This survey was inspired by the <a href="http://www.nolanchart.com/index.php">Nolan Chart</a>,
the <a href="http://www.baen.com/chapters/axes.htm">Pournelle Chart</a>,
the <a href="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">Political Compass&trade;</a>
and the <a href="http://c4ss.org/quiz">Find Your Philosophy Quiz</a>.</p>
